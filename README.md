# csun-pathfinder-automation

## Overview
This project focuses on utilizing Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm to map the walkways at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). The objective is to achieve optimal path connectivity for a line follower robot, enhancing campus operations through task automation.

### Files
- `kruskals.java`: Java source code for Kruskal's algorithm.
- `prims.java`: Java source code for Prim's algorithm.
- `kruskalsOutput.pdf`: Output results of Kruskal's algorithm run.
- `primsOutput.pdf`: Output results of Prim's algorithm run .
- `csun-robot-presentation.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project.
